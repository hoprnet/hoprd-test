//! The PIX geometry and session sizing the traffic-shape scenarios run at, and the arithmetic
//! that makes it a *profile* rather than a pile of numbers.
//!
//! # Why not the production geometry
//!
//! The deployed profile is 4608 polynomials x (64 + 16) at 10 Mbps: a cycle of 368 640 packets,
//! 306 s nominal and 10-15 min achieved. Running a shape across two of those is half an hour, and
//! five shapes is most of a day — before a sweep multiplies it.
//!
//! It is also unnecessary, because **what governs PIX is ratios, not rates.** A cycle is
//! `E = parts x (threshold + surplus)` packets and the client's SURB buffer is sized at `16 x R`,
//! so
//!
//! ```text
//! buffer / E  =  16 x R / (cycle_seconds x R)  =  16 / cycle_seconds
//! ```
//!
//! — the packet rate cancels. A buffer that is a realistic fraction of a cycle therefore depends
//! on the *cycle length* and nothing else, and a five-minute cycle reproduces the deployed ratio
//! at any rate a local cluster can sustain. The same is true of the free credit against the queue
//! depth, and of the fill rate against the recovery deadline. So this profile keeps a ~4.5 min
//! cycle and drops the rate to something a 1-hop local cluster carries comfortably.
//!
//! # What is deliberately unlike production
//!
//! [`MAX_RECOVERY_TIME`] is 12 minutes rather than two hours. It is the deadline a funded cycle
//! must recover within — and, since the Exit fills a cycle the application has left unfinished
//! rather than letting it strand, it is also the idle tariff: a Session with no traffic completes
//! at `0.75 x` it. Two hours is not a thing a test can wait out. The value is still above the
//! floor `validate_incoming_session_pix_config` enforces, so this is a legal configuration rather
//! than a test-only escape hatch — see [`MAX_RECOVERY_TIME`].
//!
//! A local cluster also has sub-millisecond transit, so the *absolute* buffer depth here is not
//! transferable to a deployment: a shallower buffer suffices when the round trip is a memcpy. Runs
//! that care drive `cluster::request_latency_profile` and say what RTT they simulated.
//!
//! # Overrides
//!
//! Every knob the sweep moves is read from the environment at run time so a grid search needs no
//! recompile — see [`surb_buffer_target`], [`max_served_without_progress`] and [`fill_enabled`].

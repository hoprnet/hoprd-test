//! PIX accounting for the edgli entry: dimensions, pricing, and the counters both ends expose.
//!
//! PIX pays the Exit for the traffic it delivers. The Entry deposits wxHOPR to a per-Session
//! stealth address; the Exit reconstructs that address's key from the SSA shares carried by the
//! return-path SURBs it spent, and sweeps the deposit into its Safe. Everything here is the Entry
//! half plus whatever is needed to *observe* the Exit half from outside.
//!
//! # Both sides move wxHOPR through their Safe
//!
//! It used to be an asymmetry, and this module was built around it: `SafePayloadGenerator::transfer`
//! emitted a **direct** `HoprToken.transfer` signed by the node key, so the Entry's deposits left
//! its *node* account while the Exit's recoveries landed in its *Safe*. hopr-types 4.0.0 routes
//! that transfer through the Safe module's `execTransactionFromModule`, so a deposit now debits the
//! Entry's Safe however it is signed. The node accounts still pay every transaction fee — and on
//! the Exit, the sweep's xDai top-up — but no wxHOPR moves through them.
//!
//! Two consequences shape everything below:
//!
//! - **Nothing here funds the Entry.** `hoprd-localcluster` gives each extra identity 1000 wxHOPR
//!   and `deploy_safe` sweeps it into the Safe, so edgli boots with the float already in the
//!   account that pays. What used to be a funding step is now a precondition to *check*, which
//!   `tests/pix.rs` does before it measures anything.
//! - **A run cannot be bounded by an empty account.** The Safe holds the channel stakes too, so
//!   "the float ran out" would mean "the stakes' leftovers ran out too" and a cycle count read off
//!   it would depend on stake arithmetic that has nothing to do with PIX. `entry_config`'s `budget`
//!   states the number outright instead — see there. (A code span rather than a link: this module
//!   is ungated and that function is not.)
//!
//! # Dimensions have to match the Exit's window
//!
//! The Exit rejects any Session whose announced quota falls outside its `quota_range`, and edgli
//! derives that quota from its own `protocol.pix` (`Edgli::pix_ssa_quota`) rather than accepting
//! one from the caller. So the two have to be sized together: `dimensions` here against
//! `hoprd-localcluster --enable-pix`, which widens the window to 1 MiB. edgli's own defaults price
//! a ~560 MB quota and would be refused outright.

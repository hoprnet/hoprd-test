//! A local UDP service the Exit forwards a Session to, for traffic shapes that are not symmetric.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every other scenario in this crate targets `SessionTarget::ExitNode(0)`, the Exit's built-in
//! loopback, which echoes each byte back. That makes a Session byte-symmetric by construction —
//! and PIX is paid for the **return** direction only, one share per return packet. So the two
//! shapes that bear hardest on it cannot be expressed against a loopback at all:
//!
//! * a **download** is heavy in the direction PIX bills, so its cycles should complete on
//!   application traffic alone;
//! * an **upload** is heavy in the direction PIX does *not* bill, so almost nothing comes back and
//!   the cycle only completes if the Exit fills it — which is the whole of what fill is for.
//!
//! Pointing the Session at `SessionTarget::UdpStream` instead gives the Exit an ordinary socket to
//! forward to. The cluster permits it: `hoprd-localcluster` generates node configs with
//! `use_target_allow_list: false`, so no allow-list stands in the way. Every node runs on
//! localhost, so the Exit reaches this service at `127.0.0.1`.
//!
//! # Why not the repo's `echo-service/`
//!
//! `echo-service/src/udp-{download,upload}.ts` implements exactly these two behaviours and is
//! already parameterised over the wire. It is also Node, built with `tsc`, and reaching it from a
//! Rust scenario would put npm on the path of a test whose subject is a PIX cycle. The k6 load
//! tests need a deployable container; this needs sixty lines and no toolchain.

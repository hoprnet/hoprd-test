//! Is a node still originating packets of its own?
//!
//! [`crate::relayers`] reads one series from `/metrics` to ask *who relayed*. This asks a different
//! question of the same endpoint: whether a node is still producing packets that start at it.
//!
//! The distinction is the whole point. A HOPR node originates packets on one path and relays them
//! on another, and the two are independent:
//!
//! | counter | produced by |
//! | ------- | ----------- |
//! | `hopr_packets_count{type="sent"}` | the egress pipeline, after routing resolution and SPHINX encode |
//! | `hopr_packets_count{type="forwarded"}` | the ingress pipeline, relaying someone else's packet |
//! | `hopr_packets_count{type="received"}` | the ingress pipeline, for packets addressed to this node |
//! | `hopr_protocol_ack_sent_count` | the acknowledgement egress task |
//!
//! Only the first depends on this node being able to resolve a route of its own. So a node whose
//! origination has stalled keeps forwarding, keeps acknowledging and keeps receiving, and looks
//! healthy to anything that does not read `sent` specifically — including its own healthcheck.
//!
//! # Reading a verdict
//!
//! `sent` frozen on its own means nothing: an idle node originates nothing either. It is only
//! evidence when read against a counter that proves the node was busy over the same window, which
//! is why [`OriginationVerdict`] carries both and why the scenarios assert on the pair.

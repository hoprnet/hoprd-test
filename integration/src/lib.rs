//! Integration-test framework for the HOPR stack.
//!
//! Brings up a 3-node `hoprd-localcluster` (anvil + blokli + 3 `hoprd` processes,
//! full-mesh channels — contracts deployed by the chain container, see
//! [`cluster`]) and an `edgli` edge client into a shared
//! [`IntegrationEnv`](env::IntegrationEnv), then pumps a payload through a UDP
//! session to the exit node's built-in loopback and measures goodput + loss.
//!
//! Each hop count is its own `#[test]` (see `tests/integration.rs`) so 0-hop and
//! 1-hop are reported independently; every test owns its cluster (bring up →
//! run → tear down). There are no tuning knobs — thresholds are hardcoded in the
//! test.
//!
//! ## Modes
//! - **Managed** (default): set `HOPRD_LOCALCLUSTER_BIN`, `HOPRD_BIN` and
//!   `HOPRD_CHAIN_URL` (a chain from `scripts/integration/lib.sh chain_up`).
//! - **External**: set `HOPRD_CLUSTER_DATA_DIR` (+ `HOPRD_LOCALCLUSTER_BIN`).

// Ungated for the same reason as `pix`: the trace arithmetic is plain code with unit tests that
// should run in the default `cargo test --lib`.

pub mod outage;
// Ungated on purpose, though only `tests/pix.rs` drives it: the balance and counter readers are
// plain parsers, and gating them would keep the subtlest logic in this crate — absent-vs-zero,
// whole-multiple reconciliation — out of the v4 `cargo test --lib` that CI runs. Only the parts
// naming edgli's PIX types are `#[cfg(feature = "v5")]`.
pub mod pix;
// Ungated for the same reason `pix` is, and with more at stake: this is the reader that tells a
// parked egress gate apart from a starved one, and its subtlety is all in the parsing — cumulative
// histogram buckets, a numeric `le`, and absent-versus-zero on a label that only exists once the
// gate has failed. Those tests belong in the default `cargo test --lib`.

// compile-time guards and unit tests are what catch a geometry edited without re-deriving what
// depends on it. Those should run in the default `cargo test --lib`, on both lines.

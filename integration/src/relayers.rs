//! Who actually carried the return traffic.
//!
//! Each `hoprd` exposes `hopr_packets_count{type="forwarded"}` on its authenticated
//! `/metrics` endpoint: a monotone count of packets the node relayed for someone else.
//! Sampling it before and after a transfer gives a per-node delta, and over a session
//! whose **forward** path is 0-hop the only packets a cluster node can forward are
//! replies on the return path. The deltas are therefore a histogram of return-path
//! first relayers — exactly the distribution that collapsed onto three nodes in the
//! 2026-08-11 incident.
//!
//! Metrics come from the node's own process, so a node that has been killed simply stops
//! answering. [`sample`] drops it rather than failing the run, and [`spread`] therefore
//! reports no delta for it — see [`spread`] for why that is the wanted behaviour here.
//!
//! **What this cannot see.** A dead node forwards nothing whether or not the sender still
//! picked it, so a zero delta after a kill does not prove the sender stopped choosing that
//! relayer — only that no traffic got through it. Use the histogram to reason about the
//! *live* relayers' shares; to reason about selection after a kill you need the sender's
//! own path-planner telemetry, which this crate does not have.

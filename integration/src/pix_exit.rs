//! The Exit's `hopr_pix_*` supervisor and egress-gate aggregates, read from its `/metrics`.
//!
//! [`crate::pix`] reads the *settlement* family, `hopr_strategy_pix_*` — deposits made,
//! keys recovered, cycles swept. That answers "did the Exit get paid". It cannot answer why a
//! Session stopped making progress, because every cause reaches it as the same symptom: `sweeps`
//! failing to increment before the budget expires. A false gate stall, a starved SURB buffer, a
//! deposit that never mined and a busy host are one reading.
//!
//! This module reads the other family — the one hoprnet#8411, #8412 and #8413 added to the
//! supervision layer — which distinguishes them:
//!
//! | what | series |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | egress parked, and why | `hopr_pix_gate_blocks_total{reason}`, `hopr_pix_gate_block_seconds{reason}` |
//! | shares accepted, and whether they advanced recovery | `hopr_pix_shares_total{kind}` |
//! | packets served, and what paid for them | `hopr_pix_egress_packets_total{mode}` |
//! | how far each cycle got, once it finalized | `hopr_pix_cycle_{egress_packets,useful_share_fraction,accepted_share_fraction}{outcome}` |
//!
//! # Why a separate reader
//!
//! [`crate::pix::PixCounters`] is `u64`-and-delta-only, which is exactly right for a family of
//! monotonic counters and wrong for this one. These are three instrument kinds with three different
//! reading rules: counters subtract, live-set gauges do not (a delta of a gauge is meaningless), and
//! histograms are bucket vectors with float sums. Widening `PixCounters` would put all three behind
//! one `get() -> Option<u64>` and hand every caller a number whose meaning depends on which series
//! it came from. hoprnet kept the same two families apart in the same way and for the same reason
//! (`transport/session/src/telemetry/mod.rs`).
//!
//! # Absent is not zero
//!
//! Carried through from [`crate::pix`], because it matters more here. A `MultiCounter` label
//! materialises when it is first incremented, so a run in which the gate never parked has **no**
//! `hopr_pix_gate_blocks_total{reason="share_lag"}` series at all. `None` from
//! [`ExitTelemetry::gate_blocks`] is therefore the *good* outcome, and
//! [`ExitTelemetry::observable`] is what separates it from "this Exit exports no PIX aggregates,
//! so nothing was measuring".
//!
//! # The exposition format
//!
//! Derived from `opentelemetry-prometheus-text-exporter`, which is what `hoprd` serves `/metrics`
//! through, rather than assumed. Four properties the parser below depends on:
//!
//! * A histogram named `N` renders as `N_count{A}`, `N_sum{A}`, one cumulative `N_bucket{A,le=B}`
//!   per bound, and a final `N_bucket{A,le="+Inf"}` equal to `N_count`.
//! * `le` is emitted **after** the attributes, and the attributes are not sorted. So a series is
//!   keyed on a *normalised* label set (see [`series_key`]) rather than on the raw label substring,
//!   which could otherwise vary between two scrapes of the same series.
//! * `le` is `f64::to_string`, so the 1.0 boundary arrives as `le="1"` and the comparison has to be
//!   numeric. [`Histogram::above`] is the accessor that does it.
//! * Buckets are **cumulative**, which is what makes both [`Histogram::above`] and the bucket-wise
//!   subtraction in [`ExitTelemetry::delta`] correct.
//!
//! `_total` is appended only when a name does not already end in it, and a unit suffix only when the
//! instrument declares a unit — `hopr-types`' wrappers never do. So every name renders as declared.

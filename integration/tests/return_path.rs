//! Return-path resilience: does a reply stream survive losing one of its relays?
//!
//! # The incident these reproduce
//!
//! On 2026-08-11 a `gnosis_vpn-client` session broke. Post-mortem: ~99.6% of the exit's
//! return SURBs named just three first relayers, so when one went away the return path
//! lost 33–44% of its packets at once — past the ~20% a reliable session tolerates — and
//! the stream corrupted rather than degrading.
//!
//! Two independent weaknesses produced that:
//!
//! 1. **Concentration.** Each return path was drawn with an independent weighted pick
//!    from one cached candidate list, so the highest-scored relayers won nearly every
//!    draw. The fix tempers the weights (`w' = w^0.5`) before sampling, which compresses
//!    the ratio between candidates without reordering them, so a good relayer still wins
//!    more often but a single one no longer owns the return stream (hoprnet#8331).
//!
//!    An earlier attempt bucketed candidates and rotated between K of them. That could
//!    never work: `MAX_SURBS_IN_PACKET` is `PAYLOAD_SIZE / HoprSurb::SIZE` = 2, so K was
//!    pinned at 2 whatever the config said, and the rotation measured 2.97 imbalance --
//!    between the two pre-fix runs rather than below them.
//! 2. **Staleness.** The exit drained its SURB buffer oldest-first, so a return path
//!    that had already changed kept being used until a multi-megabyte backlog was
//!    consumed (hoprnet#8328), and SURBs whose first hop was no longer payable were
//!    used anyway (hoprnet#8329).
//!
//! # How they are measured
//!
//! Both tests open a session whose **forward** path is 0-hop and whose **return** path is
//! 1-hop. The asymmetry is the whole trick: no cluster node relays anything on the way
//! out, so `hopr_packets_count{type="forwarded"}` on each node counts exactly the replies
//! it carried. The per-node deltas are a return-relayer histogram (see
//! [`hoprd_integration_test::relayers`]).
//!
//! - [`return_paths_should_spread_across_distinct_relayers`] measures the mechanism: the
//!   histogram must be spread, not a spike.
//! - [`session_should_survive_return_relayer_loss`] reproduces the incident: kill the
//!   busiest return relayer mid-session and require the stream to keep flowing.
//!
//! Both are `#[ignore]` (they need the external binaries and a chain) and both want more
//! relayer candidates than the throughput tests, so they run their own 5-node cluster.
//! Run with:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test --test return_path -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
//! ```

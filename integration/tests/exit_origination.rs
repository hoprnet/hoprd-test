//! Does the exit keep originating packets when one of its return paths can never be resolved?
//!
//! # The incident this reproduces
//!
//! On 2026-08-16 a `gnosis_vpn` exit node stopped originating packets at 20:46:18 UTC and never
//! originated another one. It kept forwarding, kept acknowledging, kept receiving, kept its twelve
//! peers, kept redeeming tickets, and reported healthy to its Docker healthcheck for the next
//! 1h44m. It established zero sessions in that time. There was no panic, no error line, no
//! restart, no OOM, and two sibling exits on the identical image digest absorbed the same traffic
//! and stayed healthy.
//!
//! The signature, sampled three times over twenty minutes on the wedged node:
//!
//! ```text
//! hopr_packets_count{type="sent"}       460497  460497  460497   <- frozen
//! hopr_packets_count{type="forwarded"} 2314830 2315762 ...       <- climbing
//! hopr_protocol_ack_sent_count         2858694 2859650 ...       <- climbing
//! ```
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! Every packet a node originates passes through one routing-resolution stage before SPHINX
//! encode. When resolution finds no SURB for a return route it retries every 5 ms, on the
//! assumption that the counterparty will deliver more. Once that counterparty is gone the
//! assumption never holds again, and the retry has no bound.
//!
//! The stage preserves submission order — entry-side reassembly needs it — so it withholds
//! completed work behind an unfinished item. One packet that can never resolve therefore withholds
//! *every* packet the node would originate, for as long as the process lives. Forwarding and
//! acknowledgement run on the ingress path and never touch this stage, which is why they carry on
//! and why nothing looks wrong.
//!
//! Reproduced at unit level in `hopr_transport::path::resolve`; this scenario is the end-to-end
//! proof on a real cluster.
//!
//! # How the unresolvable packet is created here
//!
//! A pseudonym's SURB ring buffer at the exit is dropped once no SURBs have arrived for
//! `pseudonyms_lifetime`. The exit's own keep-alive stream keeps emitting return-routed packets for
//! that pseudonym until the Session slot is closed. Abandoning a session at the entry — without
//! closing it, so the exit never tears the slot down — puts those two on a collision course: the
//! SURBs expire, the keep-alive fires, and there is nothing left to carry it.
//!
//! The production `pseudonyms_lifetime` is 600 s, which is longer than the Session idle timeout, so
//! the scenario shortens it to the minimum the config validator accepts. That is the only setting
//! changed, it is the same value a config file could state, and it compresses a timer rather than
//! altering an ordering.
//!
//! Run with:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test --test exit_origination -- --include-ignored --test-threads=1
//! ```

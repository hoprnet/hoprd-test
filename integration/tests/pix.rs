//! End-to-end PIX with **edgli as the paying Entry** (manual; NOT run in CI).
//!
//! hoprd's own `session_pix` covers hoprd-Entry ↔ hoprd-Exit over the REST API. This covers the
//! configuration that actually ships: `gnosis_vpn-client` embeds edgli, so in production the node
//! that opens a Session and pays for it is the edge client, linked in-process here.
//!
//! The happy path being asserted:
//!
//!   1. edgli opens a PIX Session to a cluster Exit through one relay.
//!   2. edgli's strategy deposits `price_per_byte × quota` to the SSA stealth address.
//!   3. The Exit observes the deposit and defuses its PIX kill switch, so the Session survives.
//!   4. Bidirectional traffic carries SSA shares on the return-path SURBs until the Exit
//!      reconstructs the stealth address private key.
//!   5. The Exit sweeps the deposit into its Safe.
//!   6. Repeated across several SSA cycles.
//!
//! # Prerequisites
//!
//! Both cluster binaries must come from a tree that carries PIX (hoprd#91), built in **release**
//! with the secp256k1 deposit pool. Release is not a preference: debug builds slow packet
//! processing enough to distort the cycle pacing this rests on. The pool is a *build-time* choice,
//! and a binary carrying the other one bootstraps normally and then never deposits — so
//! [`just pix`](../../justfile) greps the binary for its pool marker before starting anything.
//!
//! ```bash
//! nix develop -c cargo build --release -p hoprd -p hoprd-localcluster \
//!   --features strategy-pix-test
//! ```
//!
//! # Running
//!
//! ```bash
//! # both scenarios, ~11 min (~285 s + ~390 s, plus a chain bootstrap each)
//! HOPRD_SRC=../hoprd HOPRD_KEEP_ARTIFACTS=1 just pix > /tmp/pix.log 2>&1
//!
//! # just one
//! HOPRD_SRC=../hoprd just pix edgli_entry_deposits_should_be_swept_into_the_exit_safe
//! ```
//!
//! The two run sequentially on a fresh chain each — they want different entry budgets, and the
//! cluster binds fixed ports, so they cannot share one. `HOPRD_KEEP_ARTIFACTS=1` (the recipe's
//! default) always, or the node logs are deleted at teardown and a failed run leaves nothing to
//! read. Redirect with `>` rather than piping into `tail`: a pipeline's exit status is the last
//! command's, so a failed run reports success.
//!
//! Cargo captures test output on a pass, so the counter summaries logged below reach the log only
//! for a failing run. Add `TEST_ARGS=--nocapture` to see them on green — at the cost of every
//! `sqlx` query the nodes make.
//!
//! # Which build each participant runs
//!
//! | participant | role | comes from |
//! | ----------- | ---- | ---------- |
//! | entry (`edgli`, in-process) | opens the Session, mints SURBs, **pays the deposits** | the `edgli` git dependency, compiled into this binary |
//! | relay + Exit | forward packets, reply, recover keys, **sweep** | `$HOPRD_BIN` at runtime |
//!
//! Compile-time on one side and runtime on the other, so the two can silently disagree — and both
//! must carry PIX for anything here to mean what it says. The pool marker check covers the Exit;
//! this binary not compiling without `--features pix` covers the entry.
